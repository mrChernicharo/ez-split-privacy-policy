				<strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 1, 2025
			</p>

			<p class="mb-6">
				This Privacy Policy describes how EZSplit ("we," "our," or "us")
				handles your information when you use our mobile application,
				"EZSplit - AI Photo Bill Split" (the "App"). We are committed to
				protecting your privacy. By using the App, you agree to the
				practices described in this policy.
			</p>

				1. Information We Collect
			</h2>

			<h3 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-xl font-medium">
				1.1 Information You Provide Directly
			</h3>
			<ul class="mb-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
				<li>
					<strong>Bill Images:</strong> When you take a picture of a
					restaurant bill, this image is temporarily sent to our
					servers for immediate OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
					and AI processing to extract product names, quantities, and
					prices.
					<strong
						>These images are processed and then immediately
						discarded; they are NOT stored or retained on our
						servers after processing.</strong
					>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Participant Names:</strong> Names you enter for the
					people splitting the bill. This data is processed locally on
					your device unless you choose to create an account and save
					bill history.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Bill Edits and Allocations:</strong> Any
					modifications you make to how products are split among
					participants. This data is processed locally on your device
					unless you choose to create an account and save bill
					history.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Account Information (Optional):</strong> Creating an
					account is entirely optional and not required to use the
					main features of the App. If you choose to create an
					account, we collect only your <strong>name</strong> and
					<strong>email address</strong>. This allows you to save bill
					history and access it across devices.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>In-App Purchase Information:</strong> Details
					related to your purchases within the app. Please note that
					payment processing is handled by third-party payment
					processors (e.g., Google Play Store), and we do not directly
					store your credit card or payment details.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Feedback and Support:</strong> If you contact us for
					support or provide feedback, we collect the information you
					provide in your communication to help us address your query.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="mb-3 mt-6 text-xl font-medium">
				1.2 Information Collected Automatically (Non-Personal)
			</h3>
			<ul class="mb-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
				<li>
					<strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect
					non-identifying information about the device you use to
					access the App, such as the device model and operating
					system version. This helps us ensure app compatibility and
					performance.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Usage Data (Aggregated & Anonymized):</strong> We
					collect aggregated and anonymized information about how the
					App is used, such as features accessed and general usage
					patterns. This data cannot be used to identify you
					personally and helps us understand overall app performance
					and areas for improvement.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Crash Logs:</strong> If the App crashes, we may
					collect crash reports containing technical information about
					the crash (e.g., software version, device type). These
					reports are anonymized and used solely to diagnose and fix
					problems, improving app stability.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Advertising Identifiers:</strong> We may collect
					advertising identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID) for
					the purpose of displaying relevant advertisements within the
					App. These identifiers are not linked to your personal
					identity. You can reset or limit the use of these
					identifiers through your device settings.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold">
				2. How We Use Your Information
			</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">
				We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
			</p>
			<ul class="mb-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
				<li>
					<strong>To Provide and Maintain the App:</strong> To process
					bill images for OCR and AI analysis, facilitate bill
					splitting, and deliver the core functionality of the App.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>To Improve the App:</strong> To understand how the
					app is used (through aggregated, anonymized data) to enhance
					features, troubleshoot issues, and optimize performance.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>For Account Management (Optional):</strong> If you
					create an account, your name and email are used to manage
					your account and allow you to save and access your bill
					history.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>For Communication:</strong> To respond to your
					support inquiries and feedback.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>For Advertising:</strong> To display advertisements
					within the App.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>To Process In-App Purchases:</strong> To facilitate
					and manage your purchases within the App.

				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold">
				3. How We Share Your Information
			</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">
				We share your information only in limited circumstances:
			</p>
			<ul class="mb-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
				<li>
					<strong>With Other Participants (User Initiated):</strong>
					When you finalize a bill split, you have the option to share
					the breakdown with other participants via messaging apps or
					other platforms. This sharing is initiated and controlled by
					you.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We may share
					information with third-party vendors, consultants, and other
					service providers who perform services on our behalf, such
					as hosting, OCR/AI processing (for bill images, which are
					then discarded), and analytics. These third parties are
					obligated to protect your information and use it only for
					the purposes for which it was provided.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>For Advertising:</strong> We may share non-personal
					data (like advertising identifiers) with third-party
					advertising partners to display ads within the App. These
					partners may use this information to provide personalized
					advertisements.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your
					information if required to do so by law or in response to
					valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or
					government agency).
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with, or
					during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets,
					financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
					business by another company.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your
					information with your explicit consent or at your direction.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold">4. Data Retention</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">
				<strong
					>By default, EZSplit does not retain your bill images or
					bill split data after processing.</strong
				>
				Once a bill image is processed by our servers for OCR and AI, it
				is immediately discarded. If you do not create an account, all
				bill-related data (participant names, splits) is processed and
				stored only locally on your device and is not retained by us.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				If you choose to create an optional account, we will retain your
				name and email address for as long as your account is active to
				provide you with access to saved bill history and other
				account-related features. You can delete your account at any
				time.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				We retain anonymized usage data and crash logs for a period
				necessary to analyze trends and improve the App's performance.
			</p>

			<h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold">
				5. Your Choices and Rights
			</h2>
			<ul class="mb-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
				<li>
					<strong>Account Deletion:</strong> If you have created an
					account, you can request the deletion of your account and
					associated data by contacting us.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Opt-Out of Personalized Ads:</strong> You can often
					limit personalized ads through your device settings (e.g.,
					by resetting your advertising ID or enabling "Opt out of Ads
					Personalization" on Android). Please note that even if you
					opt out of personalized ads, you may still see
					non-personalized ads.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Permissions:</strong> You can control the
					permissions the App has on your device (e.g., camera access)
					through your device settings.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold">6. Data Security</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">
				We implement reasonable security measures to protect the limited
				information we do collect from unauthorized access, alteration,
				disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission
				over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100%
				secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
				protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
				security.
			</p>

			<h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold">
				7. Children's Privacy
			</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">
				The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.
				We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
				from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you
				are aware that your child has provided us with personal
				information, please contact us so that we can take necessary
				actions to remove that information from our servers.
			</p>

			<h2 class="mb-4 mt-8 text-2xl font-semibold">
				8. Third-Party Links
			</h2>
			<p class="mb-4">
				The App may contain links to other websites or services that are
				not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will
				be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you
				to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no
				control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
				privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
				services.
			</p>

				We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will
				notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
				this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised
